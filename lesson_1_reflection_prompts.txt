How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	I can look only to the lines that have something different and so better find the bug


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Because if I'm in a difficult situation I can return to a previous version and go on from there
	without rewrite that part of the program (and I can also remember my errors)


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that every commit rapresent a logical step
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is not only a place where to back-up file, but a device for software developers

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    After git log you can see all the commits with messages that tell you the history of files
    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because I can return every time I need it
